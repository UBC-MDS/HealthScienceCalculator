# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Behaviors that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using kind and inclusive language.  
- Valuing and appreciating different views and opinions.  
- Give and accept constructive feedback.  
- Focusing on the collective good and growth of the team.  
- Showing compassion and understanding toward others in the community.  

### unacceptable behaviors by participants include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery or making unwelcome sexual advances or inappropriate gestures.  
- Engaging in harassment, whether conducted publicly or privately.  
- Sharing someoneâ€™s personal details, such as their physical or email address, without their explicit consent.  
- Exhibiting any behavior that could reasonably be regarded as unprofessional or inappropriate in a professional context.  


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at <forgiveagbesi7478@gmail.com>. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Procedure for reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour

First strike - A written slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract.
Second strike - Reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate.
